Arrays are ordered collections of data.  The order of the array is important and each piece of data is indexed.
Examples:
[1,3,4,5]
["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"]
[[8,"a"], [9,"b"]]
[1,"bedroom", 1, "bathroom", 2, "closets"]
Arrays can be homogeneous or mixed based on the data types in them; however, most data that warrants being stored as an array tends to be of one data type, but they don't have to be.
They can also be nested or contain arrays within arrays.
The indexing system of the array works like this:
[item[0], item[1], item[2]...etc] - the first item in the array actually is index 0, not index 1 - very important!

You can return a value at a given index for an array with the following syntax:

let arr = [1,2,3];
console.log(arr[0]);
//--> 1 is printed to the console
console.log(arr[2]);
//--> 3 is printed to the console

Bottom line - arrays are super useful for data that needs to be organized in a specific fashion in which the order they appear matters.
